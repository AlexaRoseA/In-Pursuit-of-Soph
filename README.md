RIT MAGIC 2019 Game Jam project featuring the main theme of Temperance, and the sun theme of the card IX of Swords; based off of Arcana cards. 

Soph is a metroidvania platformer about a character named Soph, who is trying to balance themselves in the world. As the game progresses, their temperance raises and the projectiles they've used in the game get harder to control. After they complete each puzzle, their temperance gets set back to its original state.

Once Soph completes all the puzzles, they enters a room with a boss that represents a negative emotion. The creature's head is invincible and your projectile doesn't break on contact; This is because they're not actually real. but apart of you... a fragment of their imagination that they must fight!
